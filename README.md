Judgment Standards Experiments Code &amp; Supporting Data

This is a repository to hold the code for various experiments in what judgment standards should be, their accuracy, etc.
Feel free to log tickets against it for suggestions or additions. Contributions would be welcomed, but of course it is not really necessary, since you could just get your own GitHub.
